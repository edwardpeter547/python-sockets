# python-sockets
Welcome to this course on Python Socket Programming Tutorial. In this video we will see the Basics of Networking. The goal of this Socket programming tutorial is to learn how to build client/server applications that communicate using sockets. We are going to look at a bunch of application level protocols (HTTP, DNS, FTP, SMTP, POP, IMAP, ..). The Objective of this course is to understand principles of networking,   learn TCP and UDP features, learn to implement Python programs to access networking functionality. We will see Python examples of client and server program structures etc.
